  Upcoming HI (neutral Hydrogen) surveys will deliver large datasets, and automated processing using
  the full 3-D information (two positional dimensions and one spectral dimension) to find and characterize
  HI objects is imperative. In this context, visualization is an essential tool for enabling qualitative and
  quantitative human control on an automated source finding and analysis pipeline.

  Visual Analytics, the combination
  of automated data processing and human reasoning, creativity and intuition, supported by interactive visualization,
  enables flexible and fast interaction with the 3-D data, helping the astronomer to deal with the analysis of complex
  sources. 3-D visualization, coupled to modeling, provides additional capabilities helping the discovery and analysis
  of subtle structures in the 3-D domain.
